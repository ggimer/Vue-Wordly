  <div class="about">
    This is a word-guessing game I discovered recently. I decided to make my own
    version from scratch in order to learn Vue. It's built with Vue 3, using the
    Composition API style. I use fetch to get a random word from
    <a href="http://www.datamuse.com/api/">Datamuse API</a>, and use
    <a href="https://dictionaryapi.dev">Dictionary API</a> to check each guess
    for validity.

    The source code is available at my
    <a href="https://github.com/ggimer/Vue-Wordly">GitHub page</a>.
