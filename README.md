A word-guessing game implemented using Vue. You can <a href="https://celebrated-donut-38f384.netlify.app">play it here</a>.

This is a word-guessing game I discovered recently. I decided to make my own
    version from scratch in order to learn Vue. It's built with Vue 3,
    using the Composition API style. I use fetch to get a random word from
    <a href="http://www.datamuse.com/api/">Datamuse API</a>, and use
    <a href="https://dictionaryapi.dev">Dictionary API</a> to check each guess
    for validity.
